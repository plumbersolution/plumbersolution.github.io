<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are hassle-free if you have a changing water utilize schedule.</p>
