<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
