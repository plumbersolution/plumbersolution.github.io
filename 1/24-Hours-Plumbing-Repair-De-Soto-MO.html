<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Current advances in toilet technology have made contemporary restrooms much more comfortable and functional. It's likely costing you money every day if your toilet was manufactured prior to 1994.

Jeff Gorton, an editor at The Family Handyman, will reveal you how to remove and get rid of of a hot water heater in our video tutorial.
