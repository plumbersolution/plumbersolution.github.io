<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.
