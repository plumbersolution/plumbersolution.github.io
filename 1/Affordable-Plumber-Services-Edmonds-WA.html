Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
