<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to take a look at.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
