<p>The program accomplishes its mission by attending to the adoption and promulgation of ideal rules and policies for the building of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a brand-new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A water heater that is not installed correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
