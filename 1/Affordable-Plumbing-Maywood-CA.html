<p>Gently raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted correctly (Picture 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
