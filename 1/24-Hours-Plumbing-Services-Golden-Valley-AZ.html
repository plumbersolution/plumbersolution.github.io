<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
