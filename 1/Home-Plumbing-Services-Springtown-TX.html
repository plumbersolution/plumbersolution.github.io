<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Springtown TX</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Since of the fundamental style of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low flow or static flow condition may trigger annoyance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
