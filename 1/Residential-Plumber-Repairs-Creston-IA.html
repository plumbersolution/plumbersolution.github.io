<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<p>The typical plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Many times easy repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a repaired rate of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a fee to look at your circumstance and inform you what needs to be done, but if you employ them, that charge will be deducted from the bill.

<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink.

Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
