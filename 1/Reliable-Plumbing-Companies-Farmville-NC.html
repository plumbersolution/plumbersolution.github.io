For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
