<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
