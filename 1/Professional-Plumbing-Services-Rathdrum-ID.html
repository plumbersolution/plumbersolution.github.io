<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt.
