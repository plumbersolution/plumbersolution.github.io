<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Rancho Mirage CA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or service, and its capability to function is vital.

Little clogs can develop into big ones fairly rapidly.</p>
