A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature level or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
