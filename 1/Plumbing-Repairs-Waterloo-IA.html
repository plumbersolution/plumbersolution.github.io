<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Homeowners typically offer very little idea to their garbage disposal up until it breaks.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
