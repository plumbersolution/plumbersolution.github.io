Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
