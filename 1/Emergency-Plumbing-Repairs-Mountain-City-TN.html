<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
