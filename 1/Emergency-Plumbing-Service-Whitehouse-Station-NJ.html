Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself.

Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
