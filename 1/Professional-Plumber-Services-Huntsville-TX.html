<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can occur over time from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger in time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes appropriately. You can combat tough water in numerous ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
