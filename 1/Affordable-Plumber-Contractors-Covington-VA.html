<p>The White Glove Health & Security Plumbing Inspection covers over 100 items in the common house plumbing system. It is a FREE service with an Abacus Club Subscription (a $200 worth). You don't have to do a thing! When it's time for your annual plumbing inspection, we'll remind you. There is no easier method to keep your house's plumbing system operating at peak performance.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Everyone who's installed a few disposals understands this mistake: Forgetting to get rid of the dishwasher knockout before hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently used and you have actually replaced the flapper, the issue might be bigger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal appropriately, developing waste and a greater water expense.</p>
