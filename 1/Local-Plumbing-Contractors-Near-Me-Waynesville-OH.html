<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
