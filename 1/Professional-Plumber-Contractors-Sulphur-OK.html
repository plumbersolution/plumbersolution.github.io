If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
