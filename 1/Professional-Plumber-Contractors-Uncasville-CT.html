<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water supplies.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a bucket below the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
