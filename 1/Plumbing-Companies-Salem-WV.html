<p>Water softeners usually have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly preserved. Making sure the salt water tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
