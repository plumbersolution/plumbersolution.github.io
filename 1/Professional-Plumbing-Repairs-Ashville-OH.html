It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
