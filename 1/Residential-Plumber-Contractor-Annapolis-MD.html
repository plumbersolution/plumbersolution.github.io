<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to five days, depending upon the size of the house, the number of levels it has and the selected pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make strategic cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, re-install the eliminated drywall and spot it to remove any indications of damage or change to your house.</p>
<p>One common way for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out greatly if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific houses, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
