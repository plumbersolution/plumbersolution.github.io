<p>If it ends up being difficult to turn; it's most likely you have actually come across a clog, turn the manage counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain until you strike resistance once again, then turn the manage back and forth to work some of the clog complimentary.
