In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
