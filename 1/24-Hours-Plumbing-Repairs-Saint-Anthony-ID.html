<p>I can't state enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a really brief quantity of time due to closing on a home sale. Every individual I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to assist me through this extremely demanding job. All of individuals I experienced were good example for what a well run service company must be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're fantastic.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
