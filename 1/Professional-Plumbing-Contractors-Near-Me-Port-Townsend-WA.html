<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
