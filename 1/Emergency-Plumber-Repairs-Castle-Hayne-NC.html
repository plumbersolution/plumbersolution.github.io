It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
