<h3>Water Heater Installation in Oliver Springs Tennessee</h2>
<p>You can use a wire coat wall mount by correcting it if you don't have a plumber's snake. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some clogs. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
