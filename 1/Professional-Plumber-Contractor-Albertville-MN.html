<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of factors, including bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and corrosion. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe might have been used.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
