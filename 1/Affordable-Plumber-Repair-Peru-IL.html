<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
