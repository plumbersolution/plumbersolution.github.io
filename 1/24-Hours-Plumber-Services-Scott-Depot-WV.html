<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a requirement more than a need.

Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
