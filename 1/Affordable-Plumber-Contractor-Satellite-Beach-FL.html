<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
