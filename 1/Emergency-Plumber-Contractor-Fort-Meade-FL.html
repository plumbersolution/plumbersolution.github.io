<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
