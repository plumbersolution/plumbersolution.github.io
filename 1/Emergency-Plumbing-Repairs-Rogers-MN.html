<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.
