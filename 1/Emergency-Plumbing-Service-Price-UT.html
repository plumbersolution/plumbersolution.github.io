<p>It's an oddly complicated clinical procedure, but simple to remedy. It utilizes salt to get rid of minerals and smells found in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium.

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
