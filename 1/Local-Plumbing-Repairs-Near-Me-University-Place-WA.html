<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a family of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and available for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of rust.</p>
