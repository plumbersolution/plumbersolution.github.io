For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that obstructs the line.

Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>If you have actually cracked or broken drains up until a video inspection is carried out, it's hard to determine.
