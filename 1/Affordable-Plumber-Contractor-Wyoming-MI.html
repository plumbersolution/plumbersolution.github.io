<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Defense Plan for only $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily available, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas appliances. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals feature this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't break as quickly.</p>
<p>Over time, like any other appliance in your home, your garbage disposal. may require repairs. A disposal system might clog or begin to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, usage. A leak someplace in the system may show a worn seal. Sometimes, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC actually comes into play.
