Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies.
