<p>Debris such as foreign things - Items such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being lodged between your drainpipe and your pipes.

Eliminate the stopper from the drain while concurrently switching on the disposal. This will fill the whole disposal with soapy water and assistance to eliminate food buildup. It will also clean the blades and flush your pipes with clean water.</p>
