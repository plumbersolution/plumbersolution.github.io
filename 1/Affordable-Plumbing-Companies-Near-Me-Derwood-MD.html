<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not position a risk to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
