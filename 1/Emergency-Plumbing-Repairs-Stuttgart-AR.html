<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Stuttgart AR</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not present a danger to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
