<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Wadesboro NC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not present a danger to the water system, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
