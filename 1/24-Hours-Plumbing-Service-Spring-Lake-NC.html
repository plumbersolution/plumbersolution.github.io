Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each component. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
