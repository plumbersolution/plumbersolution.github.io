<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
