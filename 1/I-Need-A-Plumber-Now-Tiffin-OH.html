<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
