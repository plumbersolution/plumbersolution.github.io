<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
