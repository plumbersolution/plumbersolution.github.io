<p>Before our professional service technicians can start applying their skills and experience, we initially need to ensure that the line is effectively cleaned up and prepared for our repair work. Our repair processes count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws brought on by waste buildup can avoid the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and provide a mindful cleaning.</p>
