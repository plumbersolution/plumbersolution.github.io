They typically make use of sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky build-up. While effective at removing blockages, they might do your plumbing more harm than great. Here are three factors to prevent pouring these extreme chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
