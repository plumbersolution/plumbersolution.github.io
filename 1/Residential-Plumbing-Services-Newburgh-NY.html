<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and obligation are exceptionally essential to constructing a reputation for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable water supply within a building these devices are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed.
