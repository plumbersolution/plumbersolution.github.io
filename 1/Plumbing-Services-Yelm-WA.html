<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. , if you would like to try the gentlest method perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't work then utilize Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security warnings first!).
