<p>The great news is that it does not always need a repair of your entire unit if you suspect your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts break, they lead to small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
