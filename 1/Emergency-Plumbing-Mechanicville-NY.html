<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing problems plumbers face, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is prepared to overflow.

<p>Plumbers normally start out as apprentices. From there, they test and make a journey plumbing license, and ultimately be granted a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is often ground zero for clogs. As hair combines with soap, it can develop the best storm for plumbing blockages. In time, these obstructions can aggravate and avoid your bathtub from draining at all.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
