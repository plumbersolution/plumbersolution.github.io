<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your bathtubs, sinks, and showers to a local water treatment center. When drains are working correctly that's really all you need to understand about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can happen in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the know-how to diagnose an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
