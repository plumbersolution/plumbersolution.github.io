You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
