<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and constant performance of research study, vacuum, and industrial procedure systems. Examining the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be major problem. Move on to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your home must have water.
