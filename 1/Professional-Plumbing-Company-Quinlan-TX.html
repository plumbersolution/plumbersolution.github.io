<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Quinlan TX 75474</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
