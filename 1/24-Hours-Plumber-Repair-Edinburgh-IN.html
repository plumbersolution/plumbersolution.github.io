<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
