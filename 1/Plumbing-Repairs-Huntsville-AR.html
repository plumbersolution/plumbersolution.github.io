<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of preserving the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.

There is another vital component required to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
