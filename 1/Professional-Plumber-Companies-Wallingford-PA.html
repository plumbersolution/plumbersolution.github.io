<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can take place with time from the accumulation of hair, littles soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog ends up being bigger in time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes correctly. You can fight tough water in various ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>The average toilet will last for years and have very little problems that can be easily repaired without replacement.
