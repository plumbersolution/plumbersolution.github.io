<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. Since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
