<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
