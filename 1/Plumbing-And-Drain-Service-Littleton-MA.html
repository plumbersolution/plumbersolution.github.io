<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a various model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to consider. A totally various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to connect wires properly, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Though it's not always necessary, often the plumber might have to repair or upgrade circuitry to power the new garbage disposal. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot light may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or plants near the gas leak will be stained or deteriorated.
