<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids pollutants or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Many scattering systems currently have the appropriate backflow preventer installed and need just be checked annually. Others might not fulfill state and local regulations and may need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
