<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in San Diego CA 92154</h3>
<p>If it ends up being hard to turn; it's most likely you've experienced a blockage, turn the handle counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Insert it back into the drain up until you strike resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out periodically to eliminate debris up until it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
<p>This may seem like a joke, but it's extremely severe if you wish to really get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting a copy of the plumbing inspection checklist.
