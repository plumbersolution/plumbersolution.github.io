If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
