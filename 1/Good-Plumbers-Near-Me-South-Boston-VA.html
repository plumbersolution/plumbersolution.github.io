<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no adverse impacts and are, in reality, vital everyday nutrients. It is minerals that give water the rejuvenating taste many individuals find desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and reduce the effectiveness of cleaning agents and soaps. At this point the water is stated to be hard.</p>

Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair choices.</p>
