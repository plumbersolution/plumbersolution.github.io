<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them challenging to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your unit is at completion of its life expectancy, particularly if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Whether you have a waste disposal unit and it's not working properly, or if it's finally time to install one in your house, a garbage disposal is a former high-end that is almost a need in these times. Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain.</p>
