These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
