<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a structure permit is normally required prior to a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften only what you need to. People frequently select to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be linked to a softener. In a lot of cases, people choose to soften just the warm water.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
