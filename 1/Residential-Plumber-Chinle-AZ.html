<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc.

Copper is also commonly used due to the fact that of its longevity and much safer construction, however polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the marketplace and ensures the healthiest and cleanest water circulation.</p>
