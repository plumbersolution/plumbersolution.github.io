<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
