When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
