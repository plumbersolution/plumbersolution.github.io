<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
