<p>It is not constantly due to obstructions that originate inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems.
