<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>

<p>Very seldom does any structural damage occur as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is generally spotted prior to it causes any substantial damage.
