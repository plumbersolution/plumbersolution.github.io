<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, examine the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
