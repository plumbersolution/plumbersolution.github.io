<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
