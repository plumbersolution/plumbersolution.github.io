If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

We provide a number of affordable and extremely effective systems, and supply upfront prices prior to work starts so there are not a surprises.
