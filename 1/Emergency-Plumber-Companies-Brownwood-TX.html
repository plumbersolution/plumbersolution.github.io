<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leakages are sneaky.

<p>Bought middle ground stainless steel blade model readily available at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I believe. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for two guys.
