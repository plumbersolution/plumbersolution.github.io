<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Leakages are sneaky. You have probably seen drain cleaner products on the racks at your local home enhancement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining pipes water like it should, you may be tempted to head down there and pick some as much as fix it by yourself.

In many cases it's more helpful to hire a professional plumber in Utah.</p>
<p>Bought middle ground stainless steel blade model readily available at Lowes. Got a small local plumber who overcharged me, I believe. $212 with tax for installation only, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for two guys.

<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet.
