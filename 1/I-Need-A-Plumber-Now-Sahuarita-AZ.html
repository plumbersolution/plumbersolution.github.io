The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
