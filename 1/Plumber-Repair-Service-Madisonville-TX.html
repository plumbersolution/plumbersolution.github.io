<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Madisonville TX</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Was your home developed before the 1970s and has not undergone renovation or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and rotted over the years if so. Older pipes can trigger significant leakages and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last forever and will need to be changed.</p>
