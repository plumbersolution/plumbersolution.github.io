<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system.

Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
