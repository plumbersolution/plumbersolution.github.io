It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
