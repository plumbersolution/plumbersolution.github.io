<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
