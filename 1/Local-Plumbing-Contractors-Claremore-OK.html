For example, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit contaminants or pollutants to enter the safe and clean water system. Illness can result from consuming water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
