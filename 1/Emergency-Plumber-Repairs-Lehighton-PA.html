<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit is available in two basic types - constant feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to run the system. Continuous feed is common and the simplest to use; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to utilize on large amounts of food waste since you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hampering water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to land fills and other disposing locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
