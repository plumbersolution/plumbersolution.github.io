Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are one of the most common indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, specifically if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>

Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department need to fulfill or surpass the state requirements and bring the obligation for implementing them.</p>
