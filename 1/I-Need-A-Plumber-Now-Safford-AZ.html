<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Safford AZ</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
