<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Rocky Mount VA</h3>
<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than just an expensive repair-- they can result in substantial and costly residential or commercial property damage and lead to severe health risks. Sewer line repair is the first line of defense when a sewer line stops working. If the sewer line can't be fixed, sewer line replacement is the just other choice. Thankfully, Mr. Rooter ® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about switching to a tankless water heater, it's an excellent concept to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this advanced choice. While tankless water heaters are fantastic in lots of aspects, they are not ideal for everybody. For instance, homes with a great deal of family members or roommates, in addition to those that require more than average quantities of hot water daily, will most likely benefit more from a traditional tank hot water heater.</p>
