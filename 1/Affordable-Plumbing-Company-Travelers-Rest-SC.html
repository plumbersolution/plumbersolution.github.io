<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, generally regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
