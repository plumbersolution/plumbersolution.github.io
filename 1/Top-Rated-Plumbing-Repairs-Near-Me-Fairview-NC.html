When these parts wear, they result in tiny leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise result in flooding and water damage.</p>

Elements involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, ought to be reconfigured.</p>
