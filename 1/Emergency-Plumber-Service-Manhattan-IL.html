<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
