<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system.
