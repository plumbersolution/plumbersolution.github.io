<p>Property owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is specifically prudent to organize inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a brand-new home.

<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material utilized in plumbing.

However, house owners with waste disposal unit and septic tanks may have to pump their septic regularly.
