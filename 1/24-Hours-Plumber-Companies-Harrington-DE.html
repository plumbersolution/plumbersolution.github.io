<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.
