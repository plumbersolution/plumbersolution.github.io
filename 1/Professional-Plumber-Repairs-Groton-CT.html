<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
