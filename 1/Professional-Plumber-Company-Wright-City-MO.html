<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
