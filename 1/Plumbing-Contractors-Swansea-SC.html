<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician turned off the supply of water and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The client assisted our technician in moving the toilet back into its proper place, and the service technician tightened up the bolts before restoring the supply of water and guaranteeing that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The absence of warm water is the most significant indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.
