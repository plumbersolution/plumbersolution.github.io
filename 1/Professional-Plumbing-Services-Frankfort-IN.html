<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
