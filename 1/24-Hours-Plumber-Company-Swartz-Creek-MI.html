<p>A normal whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to 5 days, depending on the size of the home, the number of levels it has and the selected pipe product.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).
