<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply.

Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
