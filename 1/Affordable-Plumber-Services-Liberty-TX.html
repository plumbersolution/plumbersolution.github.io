<p>You reside in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
