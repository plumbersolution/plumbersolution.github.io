Instead of needing to put the waste into the garbage, where it could potentially end up in a land fill, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into small particles that can be flushed to the septic tank or sewer.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another suggestion to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
