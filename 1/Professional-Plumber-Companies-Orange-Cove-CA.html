<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
