<p>It is approximated that the typical individual spends over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and lots of bathroom readers are at danger of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why choosing a comfy, reliable toilet seat is incredibly essential. However, you have to ensure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet.

<p>The flange is a pipe fitting that does two jobs. It protects the toilet to the floor and also connects the toilet to the drain pipe.
