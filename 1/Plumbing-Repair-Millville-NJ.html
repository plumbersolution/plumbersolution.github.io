<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where firmness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline kind that will not cling to surfaces.
