<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
