A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals.
