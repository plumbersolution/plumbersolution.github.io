<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Service in West Salem</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same material as other pipes in your house, meaning that difficulty could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you peace of mind and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
