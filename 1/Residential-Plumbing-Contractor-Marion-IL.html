<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.
