<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Tank water heaters are the most typical, and are kept up gas. Their design consists of an insulated tank where water is heated and stored until needed.

<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter circumstances, quite often that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd love to post some pictures of this. Just look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
