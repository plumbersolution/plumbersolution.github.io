There are also numerous cost points for new faucets to fit every style and budget plan. The kind of brand-new faucet you pick may be limited by the number of pre-drilled holes in your existing bathroom or kitchen countertop. When faucet and sink problems need replacement, our plumbers have a broad selection of faucet replacements right on their truck, generally removing a follow-up service call and getting your plumbing problem solved on the spot.</p>

<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system.
