<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall.

The water in your shower, toilet, or sink drains slowly - This is the most typical sign that you have actually got a drain blockage.

Instead, a garbage disposal includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.
