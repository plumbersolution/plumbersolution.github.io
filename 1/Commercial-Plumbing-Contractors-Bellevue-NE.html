It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
