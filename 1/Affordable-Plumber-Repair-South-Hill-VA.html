<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing service. When searching for a brand-new flapper, your best option is to attempt and find the exact same flapper that originally came with your existing flush valve.

If you do not understand your design number, however, we do use an extensive selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out.

Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>
