<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Mapleton Utah</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
