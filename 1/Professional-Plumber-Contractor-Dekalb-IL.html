<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a little bit of warm water. Whether tree roots have actually made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never an enjoyable experience.
