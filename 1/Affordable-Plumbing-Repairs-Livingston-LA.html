Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger obstructions and jams - consider composting or putting these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
