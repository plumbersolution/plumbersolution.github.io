<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution.
