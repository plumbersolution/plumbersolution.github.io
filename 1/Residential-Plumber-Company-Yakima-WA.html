Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate alternative to do just that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
