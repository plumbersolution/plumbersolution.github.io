You likewise need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an unusual flow, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature or pressure may need changing the hot water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
