<p>I have actually been impressed with your company and its individuals from the day your sales individual strolled in here, through all service personel, and now. By the method, this is a great system. Our energy costs are much lower then previously, the airflow is almost unnoticeable, the air temp inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures considering that installation.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it also. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, worn sink? No problem is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing team gets the job done quickly and economically.</p>
