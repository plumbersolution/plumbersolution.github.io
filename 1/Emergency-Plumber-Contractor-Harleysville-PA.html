<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working successfully since hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
