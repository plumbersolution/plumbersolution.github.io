<p>Leaks - Next, leaks represent the most common cause for kitchen sink repair. Generally, they begin small and go unnoticed, and after time can lead to large puddles beneath your sink and cabinets. This type results in possible water damage. Many other types of leaky kitchen sinks which are annoying however are typically fixed easily. Connection issues between the faucet and water system line or sprayer hose, and missing gaskets in between the faucet and sink are huge transgressors.

<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes.
