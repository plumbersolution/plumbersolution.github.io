<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Imperial CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>This is exceptionally important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system.
