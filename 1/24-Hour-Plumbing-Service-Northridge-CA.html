<p>As soon as the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of piping that are utilized in the repiping procedure. Because of their effectiveness, safety and cost, copper piping and PEX piping are used.
