<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Service in Folsom</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
