<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will establish.

<p>Many Chicago house owners do not think of their sewer and drain lines till there's a problem.

<p>Galvanized metal, is just an easier way of stating zinc layered" and what causes galvanized pipes to wear away is the exposure to too much water and minerals. You may be believing that it does not make sense to utilize a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transportation, and you would be correct.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
