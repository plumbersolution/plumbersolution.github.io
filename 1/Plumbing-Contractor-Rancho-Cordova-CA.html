<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
