<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
