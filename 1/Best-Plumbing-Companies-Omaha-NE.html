Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions.

<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing concerns plumbers deal with, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow.
