<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are sometimes perceived as a required to have them. However the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>

For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to stream backwards into city water products.</p>

Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were great at repairing the clogged drain, but really really sloppy about repairing the chip in the sink and making use of puddy under the sink.</p>
