<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is fairly short. Crisp or soft foods are great, but tough or stringy foods can be problem. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching twist-ties and pads. While some older homes might not have backflow preventers, all more recent residential or commercial properties are required to have them. If you're not exactly sure what type of backflow preventers are used in your house or company, Doug's can help you locate and identify them. We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Relatively unused and even somewhat unidentified in the remainder of the world, garbage disposers are a nearly universal feature of the American kitchen.

In this tutorial, we'll be covering the fundamentals of both common mounting systems, and offering some valuable suggestions to make sure an effective installation.</p>
