Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property.
