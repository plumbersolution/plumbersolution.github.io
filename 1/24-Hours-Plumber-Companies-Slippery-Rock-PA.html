<p>Leaking gas can lead to asphyxiation and hazardous surges. Luckily, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong smell added to them so that leaks can be more easily found by homeowners.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
