<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Rockledge FL 32955</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
