<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Rutland MA</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
