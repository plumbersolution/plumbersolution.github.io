<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
