<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
