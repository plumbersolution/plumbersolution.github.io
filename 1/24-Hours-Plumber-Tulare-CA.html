<p>Stegle Plumbing has taken on more than just the residential work, completing a number of current commercial tasks as well.A current commercial plumbing task as a subcontractor was a 3,500-square-foot building for a church.

They also plumbed the ADA restrooms.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
