<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house. Even if the issue originates with the local system, it's still clever to generate the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

<p>While pipe lining is an excellent alternative for most people, there are some circumstances where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the process of replacing old rusty pipes with durable and lasting brand-new pipes. The new pipes that are utilized are generally made of copper because of their sturdiness and other aspects. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
