Tucson, AZ based Cal's Plumbing supplies comprehensive drain and sewer services.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indications of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, studs, and floors.
