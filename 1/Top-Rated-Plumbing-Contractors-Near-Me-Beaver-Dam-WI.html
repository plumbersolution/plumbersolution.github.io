<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
