<p>If you observe low water pressure or stained water, it usually signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening systems are for that reason also known as ion exchange water softeners. The best method to clear a clogged drain without harming your pipes and plumbing system is to get in touch with a trusted local plumber at ABC. The pipe that links your sink to the main supply, includes water at high pressures. A leak in this system will be immediately obvious. The defected part will either spray or drip profusely, depending upon the damage.</p>
