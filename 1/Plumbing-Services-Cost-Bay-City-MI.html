<p>A weird gurgling noise when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a great sign. Do not depend on a plunger to correct the problem-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair. As we have stated before backflow prevention gadgets and assemblies reduce pressure and volume offered to the life security and home security systems.  Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Typically, this operating system is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
