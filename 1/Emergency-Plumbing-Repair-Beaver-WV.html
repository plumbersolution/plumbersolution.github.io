<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
