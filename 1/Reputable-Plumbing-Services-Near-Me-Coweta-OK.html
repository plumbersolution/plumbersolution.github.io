I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
