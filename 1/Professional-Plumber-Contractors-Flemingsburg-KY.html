It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
