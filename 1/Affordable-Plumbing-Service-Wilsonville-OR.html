<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
