<p>Bear in mind that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you should just hire a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to guarantee that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs range from $33 to $89 per drip leg.
