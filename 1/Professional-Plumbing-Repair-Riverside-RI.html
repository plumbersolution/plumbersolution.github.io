<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
