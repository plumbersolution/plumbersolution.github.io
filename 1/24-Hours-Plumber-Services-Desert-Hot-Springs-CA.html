If a clogged storm drain is not resolved in a timely way, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically channelled somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be vulnerable to obstructing because there just isn't enough a high enough circulation to eliminate the particles.</p>
