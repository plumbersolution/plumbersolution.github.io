<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water firmness if you do not see limescale accumulation but instead see soap scum, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting delicate and scratchy. If you smell gas, do not attempt to find the leak. Instead, leave the house or building right away.

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>When set up, these BPAs are subject to routine and initial testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued operational effectiveness. Such testing must be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester registered with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific details is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>

If the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration, demand that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
