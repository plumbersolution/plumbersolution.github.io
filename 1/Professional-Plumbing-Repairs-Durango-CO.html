<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
