<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

This included with other debris in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
