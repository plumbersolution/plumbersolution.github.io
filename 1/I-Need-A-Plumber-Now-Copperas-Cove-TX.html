He noted that there are specific contaminants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils which too can be remedied with the right RO system.</p>
