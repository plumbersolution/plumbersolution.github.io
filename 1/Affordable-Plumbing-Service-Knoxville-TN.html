<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, indicating that difficulty could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and prevent larger leaks down the road.</p>
