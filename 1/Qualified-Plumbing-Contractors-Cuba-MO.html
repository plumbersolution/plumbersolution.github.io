<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
