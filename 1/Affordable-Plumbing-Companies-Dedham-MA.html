<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is actually a safe germs that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home.

<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would generally trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually end up being worn and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater extremely quickly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
