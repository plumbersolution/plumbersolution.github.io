Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
