<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
