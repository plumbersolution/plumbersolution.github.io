<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
