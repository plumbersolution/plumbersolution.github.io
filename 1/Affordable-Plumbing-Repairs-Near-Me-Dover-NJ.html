<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>It's an excellent idea to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain professional like TLC will use a camera to inspect your drain system. Frequently, if you have multiple drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can determine the issue and find so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
