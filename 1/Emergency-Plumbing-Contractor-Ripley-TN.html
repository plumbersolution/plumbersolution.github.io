May be contacted as consultants throughout a house's planning stages; they are instrumental in ensuring new construction or renovation remains in compliance with local, and federal building codes (which commercial plumbing complies with all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>
<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC specializes in the installation and repair of commercial and residential gas and propane gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and consultation services. If your commercial home already has a backflow preventer, you're responsible for having it evaluated each year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List We will inform you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>In regards to the equipment that will be examined, there are 2 possible alternatives: a decreased pressure principle device or double check valves. Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were wonderful at repairing the clogged drain, but very very careless about fixing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
