<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, most drain problems can only be spotted once they start to back up. But, during routing plumbing inspections, a full test of all drains will be performed. Plumbers can try to recreate problems to identify if something may be occurring behind the walls or in the ground. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is far more effective at eliminating blockages. Numerous homes have drain cleanouts, however, we experience older houses without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can add cleanouts to your house.</p>
