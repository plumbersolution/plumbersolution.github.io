High energy costs? It may be time for a new hot water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed appropriately. A hot water heater that is not installed properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Conventional tank water heaters: These heaters use electrical energy and gas for fuel. They can heat anywhere from 20 to 100 gallons of water at a time.

<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
