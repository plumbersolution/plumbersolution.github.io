<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
