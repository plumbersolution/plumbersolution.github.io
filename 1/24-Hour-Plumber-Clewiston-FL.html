The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
