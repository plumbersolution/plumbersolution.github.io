<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
