<p>The heating element is taking longer to heat the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this specific issue is when you have no hot water streaming in your house. The factors for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the mentioned issues, a repair or replacement of the parts may be enough. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place often, then a hot water heater replacement is necessary.</p>
