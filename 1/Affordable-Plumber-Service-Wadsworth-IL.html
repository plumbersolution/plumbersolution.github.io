<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions.

If you smell gas, do not try to locate the leak. Instead, leave your house or building immediately. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, devices, or lights, as an electrical charge might develop a stimulate. When you remain in a safe place, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.
