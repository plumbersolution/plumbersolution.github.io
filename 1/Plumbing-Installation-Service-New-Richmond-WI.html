<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very important part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
