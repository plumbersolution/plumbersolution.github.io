<p>This warranty qualifies and represents all other guarantees to the customer, whether revealed or suggested. This service warranty disclaims without constraint suggested service warranties of merchantability or physical fitness for a particular function or treatment of particular water conditions.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
