<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently since hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them.

Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
