<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular impurities that locals are handling and an RO can help minimize those problems. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
