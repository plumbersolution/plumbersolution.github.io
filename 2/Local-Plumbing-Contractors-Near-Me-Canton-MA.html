<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your sink, tub or shower. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to remove.

<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old.
