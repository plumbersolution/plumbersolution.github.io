<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
