<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning devices have actually been marketed based on a variety of claims concerning their effect on water solidity and related scale formation. The Water Quality Association, a not-for-profit trade association for the water treatment industry, has not been able to figure out requirements for these items and report irregular efficiency to date.
