Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
