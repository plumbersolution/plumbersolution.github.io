<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains.

Nevertheless, to thwart off that risk, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
