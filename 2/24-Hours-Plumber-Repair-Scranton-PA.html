Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
