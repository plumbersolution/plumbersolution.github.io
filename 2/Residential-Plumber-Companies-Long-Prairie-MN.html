<p>To identify if your house is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can likewise be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you understand that you have a history of obstructing or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will send the results to us. Be sure to discover a plumber you trust who will get the task done right at a reasonable cost if you need a garbage disposal replacement.</p>
