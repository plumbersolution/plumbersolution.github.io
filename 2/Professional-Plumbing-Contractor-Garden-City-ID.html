<p>Natural gas is an important utility we use every day to keep our workplaces and homes warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the daily usage of gas, it is reasonable it is understandable that with time a leak is bound to happen. When a leak appears, it is necessary to understand the indications, signs, and how to act. Remember to take safety measures when handling gas appliances, use the aforementioned signs to determine potential leaks, and call a plumber to have your gas lines routinely examined and maintained.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
