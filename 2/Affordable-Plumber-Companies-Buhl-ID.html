<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction.
