<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, benefit, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. The most typical drain problem we are called for is problems with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is slow to drain. Normally, drainage problems are a sign that there is a clog or build-up inside your drains which needs to be cleaned out. Our Santa Fe drain cleaning specialists have all of the needed training and tools to examine and clear out your drains.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
