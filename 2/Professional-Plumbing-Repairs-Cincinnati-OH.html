<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Cincinnati Ohio</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
