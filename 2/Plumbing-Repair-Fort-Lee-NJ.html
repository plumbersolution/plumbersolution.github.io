<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Fort Lee New Jersey</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief.
