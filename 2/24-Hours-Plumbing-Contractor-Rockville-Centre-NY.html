<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of secondary and main backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of security for the general public water supply system.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
