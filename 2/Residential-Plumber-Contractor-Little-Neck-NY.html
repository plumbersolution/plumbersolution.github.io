<p>Installed 50 gallon electrical hot water heater and thermal expansion tank. When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to observe gurgling sounds, water backing up into your sink or shower, or unusual smells.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
