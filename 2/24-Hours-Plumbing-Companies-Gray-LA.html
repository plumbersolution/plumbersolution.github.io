This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
