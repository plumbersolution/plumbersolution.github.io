<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
