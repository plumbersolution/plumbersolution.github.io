<p>Shut of the power to it at your main breaker panel before your start loosening any pipes or supply lines if you have a garbage disposal. Whole-house repiping can definitely be a big undertaking, which is why the service is just performed when absolutely necessary.

Changing and setting up brand-new pipes can take anywhere between 3-5 days depending upon the size of your house.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
