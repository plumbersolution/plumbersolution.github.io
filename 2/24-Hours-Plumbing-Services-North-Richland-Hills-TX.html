<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
