A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals.
