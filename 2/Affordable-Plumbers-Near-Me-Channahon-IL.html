<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
