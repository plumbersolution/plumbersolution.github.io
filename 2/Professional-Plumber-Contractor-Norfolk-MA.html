<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Norfolk MA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now.

I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
