<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve cash.
