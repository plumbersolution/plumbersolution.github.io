<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies.
