<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.

If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
