<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
