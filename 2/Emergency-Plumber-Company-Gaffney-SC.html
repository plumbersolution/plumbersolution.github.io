<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high price tag makes it unwise as a household service.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
