<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of keeping the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is one other vital component required to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of great deals of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face situations, quite often that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. In some cases, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not safely operate and get in the basement until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is usually cleaned.
