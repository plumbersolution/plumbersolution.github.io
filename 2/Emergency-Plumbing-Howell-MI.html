It depends upon perspective, and what you as a private feel are the benefits you and your household need the majority of.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
