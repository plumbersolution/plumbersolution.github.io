<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
