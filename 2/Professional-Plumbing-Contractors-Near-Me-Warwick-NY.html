This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
