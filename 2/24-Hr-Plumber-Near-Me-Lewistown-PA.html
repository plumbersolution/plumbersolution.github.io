<p>With PVC you have a couple of options if your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout, certainly replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do simply that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
