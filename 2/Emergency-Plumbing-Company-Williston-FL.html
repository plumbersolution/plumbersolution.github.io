<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
