<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you should just hire a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record moisture so that it doesn't go into the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
