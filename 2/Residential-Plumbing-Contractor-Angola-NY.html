<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning innovation to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a exceptional and resilient  choice for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the process is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
