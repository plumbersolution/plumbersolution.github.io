<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
