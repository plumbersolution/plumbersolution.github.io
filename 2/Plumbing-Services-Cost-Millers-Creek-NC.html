<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
