The membrane has pores large enough to confess water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
