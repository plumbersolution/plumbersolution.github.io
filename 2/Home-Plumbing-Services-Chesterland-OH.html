<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Possible impurities can then enter the safe and clean water system. The very best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't require repairing the entire toilet. Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes many small moving parts that may need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leaks that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
