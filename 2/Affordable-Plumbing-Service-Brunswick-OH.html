<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
