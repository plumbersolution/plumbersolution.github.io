<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to initially obtain the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page to find out more on getting a license. Once you get a permit you can begin with the work. However, you should require inspection prior to you cover or conceal any work.</p>

<p>Plumbers normally start out as apprentices. From there, they earn a journey and evaluate plumbing license, and ultimately be awarded a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is often ground zero for blockages. As hair combines with soap, it can develop the perfect storm for plumbing clogs. In time, these blockages can aggravate and avoid your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt discarding a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it also. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No issue is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing team finishes the job rapidly and economically.</p>
