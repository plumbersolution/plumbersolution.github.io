<p>There are 2 kinds of piping that are used in the repiping process. Copper piping and PEX piping are utilized because of their security, cost and performance. Copper piping avoids bacteria from growing inside of the pipe offering healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic product that is both flexible and lightweight. This product is resistant against deterioration and will help improve water pressure.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
