The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

If something inside the system fails, you could be entrusted to no hot water The discharge line is pressurized and can run some distance. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain? Even a kitchen or bathroom sink drain will make much better connection than running exterior.</p>
