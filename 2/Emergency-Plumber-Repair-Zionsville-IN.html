When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern hot water heater also count on electrical parts. If something inside the unit fails, you could be entrusted to no hot water The discharge line is pressurized and can run some distance. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain?
