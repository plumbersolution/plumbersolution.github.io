<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Ponte Vedra Beach FL 32082!</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items consisting of extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. A completely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires properly, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
