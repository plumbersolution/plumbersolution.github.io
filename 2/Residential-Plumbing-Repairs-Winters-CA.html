Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life.
