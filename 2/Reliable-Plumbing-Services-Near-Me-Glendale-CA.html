<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is very important to see what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
