<p>This is a complicated job that should constantly be left to an experienced professional from McAtee Plumbing Heating & Cooling using the current tools and reliable techniques. You can not merely replace the a few of the bad piping, instead, to prevent future costly repairs and guarantee a long life expectancy, the entire piping system on your Charleston residential or commercial property need to be changed.</p>
<p>A variety of pipe products are used for entire home repiping, consisting of PEX and copper pipe. The cost varies, depending upon the type of product and size of your house. We more than happy to provide estimates for whole home pipe replacement and financing options are available for big tasks.

<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the supply of water pipes in a house or building. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a procedure of installing a new water line plumbing system. This process typically includes removing old readily available pipes and then installing the new plumbing system.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
