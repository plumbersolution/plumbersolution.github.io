<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
