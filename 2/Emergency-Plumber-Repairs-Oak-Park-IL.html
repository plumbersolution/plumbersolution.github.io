<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to initially acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for more information on getting an authorization. Once you acquire a license you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you need to call for inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>

<p>Handheld sprayer. Leakages can often establish on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink.
