<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Breckenridge TX</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately maintained. Making certain the salt water tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also protect the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
