In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
