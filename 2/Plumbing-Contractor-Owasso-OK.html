<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening.

Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
