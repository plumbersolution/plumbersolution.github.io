<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
