<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and might in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink film is actually a safe germs that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your house. When the brand-new salt has had a chance to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
