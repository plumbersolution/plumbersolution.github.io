<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
