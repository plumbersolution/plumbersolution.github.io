Prior to installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is attached to its mount. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>

<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
