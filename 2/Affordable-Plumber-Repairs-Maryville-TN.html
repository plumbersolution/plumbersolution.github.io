<p>Lots of homeowners believe their energy companies or property owners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the reality is that in many cases you, the property owner, are responsible.

The new pipes that are used are usually made from copper because of their resilience and other elements. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
