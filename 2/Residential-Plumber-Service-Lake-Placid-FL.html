<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Natural gas is tough to find, as it's a colorless, odor free substance. We use natural gas in our houses with gas ovens, ranges, and heaters.
