<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
