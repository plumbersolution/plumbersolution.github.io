<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Examining the water, age, and condition lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers comprehend numerous things, including water pressure and indications of leaks. If the hot water heater has been kept with yearly flush service, it can likely last beyond its basic service warranty. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to prospective contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>

<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
