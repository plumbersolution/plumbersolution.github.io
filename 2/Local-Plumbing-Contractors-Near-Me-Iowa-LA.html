<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in Iowa</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
