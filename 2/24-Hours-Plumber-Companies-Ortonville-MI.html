<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
