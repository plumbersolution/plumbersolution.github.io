<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Saint Clair Shores MI</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
