When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to satisfy or surpass the state standards and carry the duty for implementing them.</p>
<p>Purchasing a home is a big financial investment. Knowing if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be handy when negotiating the sale of a home.
