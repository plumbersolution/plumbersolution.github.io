<p>Letters are sent out to residential clients with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal unit to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off.

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
