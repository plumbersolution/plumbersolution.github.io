<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Jackson OH</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
