<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make sure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in.
