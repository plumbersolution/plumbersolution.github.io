<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
