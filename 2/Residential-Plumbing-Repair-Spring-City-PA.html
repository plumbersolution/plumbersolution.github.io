Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
