<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the hardness of Woodbury's water. Hardness can look like a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip because it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes. It likewise hinders soap and detergent use.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
