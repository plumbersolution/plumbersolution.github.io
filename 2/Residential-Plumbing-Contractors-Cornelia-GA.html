<p>It usually symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or tarnished water. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health danger in your water.</p>
