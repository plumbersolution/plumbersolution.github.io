<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for locals.

That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
