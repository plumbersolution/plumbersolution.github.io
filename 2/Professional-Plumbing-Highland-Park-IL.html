<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Highland Park IL</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
