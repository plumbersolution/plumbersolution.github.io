<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older home.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium.
