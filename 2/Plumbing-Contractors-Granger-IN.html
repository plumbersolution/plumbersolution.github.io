<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
