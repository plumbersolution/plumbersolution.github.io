Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
