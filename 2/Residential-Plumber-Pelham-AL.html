<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
