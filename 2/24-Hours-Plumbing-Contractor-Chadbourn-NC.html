<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Chadbourn NC 28431</h3>
<p>The fuel line of your car supplies gas from the fuel tank to the carburetor, making the combustion essential for the engine to run. You might have a gas leak from the fuel line if you smell a strong whiff of gas from your cars and truck when it is running. It is important to repair this immediately to prevent a surge. It is best to take your cars and truck to a certified mechanic if you are not specific of your repair capabilities.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services.
