<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or organisation, and its ability to function is essential.

Little obstructions can develop into big ones relatively rapidly.</p>
