Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
