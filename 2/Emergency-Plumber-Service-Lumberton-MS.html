But the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
