Sediment Accumulation: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>Today, the majority of professionals recommend a mindful inspection of residential water heaters regularly - at least every year. Malfunctioning water heaters cause a range of problems.
