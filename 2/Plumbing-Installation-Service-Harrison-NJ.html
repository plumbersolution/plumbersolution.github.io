<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Garbage disposals also need to have regular use to prevent deterioration. Magnesium and calcium are positively charged ions. Other positively charged ions will dissolve less quickly in hard water than in water that does not include calcium and magnesium because of their presence. Assemblies will not be installed in locations containing destructive, poisonous or harmful fumes or gases which might render the assembly inoperable or pose a security hazard to personnel.</p>

<p>When drains are clogged, it is not constantly due to blockages that come from inside the house. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will determine the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
