DO use a lot of water each time you grind up food residue, and keep water running for a couple of seconds after the disposal is done. When you're ready to actually install your waste disposal unit, follow these actions below courtesy of Lowe's job professional, Hunter Macfarlane.

<h3>Leak Repair in Stratford New Jersey</h2>
