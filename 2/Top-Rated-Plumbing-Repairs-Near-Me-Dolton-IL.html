<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Dolton IL 60419</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
