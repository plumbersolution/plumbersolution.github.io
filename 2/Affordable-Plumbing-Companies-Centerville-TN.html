<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both indoors and underground, DCVs are a little bit more costly but are likewise highly practical, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically.

<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the hardness ions to speed up.
