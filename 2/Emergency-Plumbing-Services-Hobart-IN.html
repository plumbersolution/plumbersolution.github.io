Sediment from these aspects not only dry out your skin and hair but also develop in pipes and appliances lowering their efficiency and life span.

The effects of hard water can be seen on your dishes, the color and softness of your clothes, the film on your shower door and even your individual look and comfort.</p>
<p>Before salt starts working in a water softener it requires a little residence time within the tank, because the salt is dissolving gradually.
