<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
