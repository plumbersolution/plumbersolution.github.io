<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Bedminster NJ 07921</h3>
<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with tough water, you may not understand how much it affects you-- but if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
