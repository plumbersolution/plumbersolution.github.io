<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
