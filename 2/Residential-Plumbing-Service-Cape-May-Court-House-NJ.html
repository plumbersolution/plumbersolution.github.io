<p>Since it can spread polluted water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a possible issue in a water system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection between the general public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable contaminants or impurities to enter the drinkable water supply. Sickness can result from consuming water that has been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or pull out a toilet. This is normally more labor-intensive and might need additional costs.
