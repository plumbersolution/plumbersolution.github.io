Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
