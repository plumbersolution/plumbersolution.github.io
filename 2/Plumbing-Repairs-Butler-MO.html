<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly safeguarded, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter season freezing. The new pipe, made from a high-tech, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are removed to attach the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood states.
