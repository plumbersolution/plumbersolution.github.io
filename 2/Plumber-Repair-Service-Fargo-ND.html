<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Fargo ND</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a threat to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
