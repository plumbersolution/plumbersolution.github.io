<p>Our plumber groups aim to keep your house and work locations effective, practical and comfortable. When it rains, any excess water is expected to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason requires to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely manner, the possibilities are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
