They are interesting in safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source offered to achieve that goal.

A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in specific houses, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
