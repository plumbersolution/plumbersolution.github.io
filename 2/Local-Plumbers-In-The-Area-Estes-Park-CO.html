If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
