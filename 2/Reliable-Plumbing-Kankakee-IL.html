<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.

If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities.
