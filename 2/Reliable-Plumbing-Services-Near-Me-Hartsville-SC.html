<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Hartsville SC</h3>
<p>All of us experience a clogged drain eventually. You can try to take matters into your hands by using everyday items, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, especially if you are dealing with a little drain clog. Nevertheless, they are typically momentary fixes that do not offer irreversible resolutions.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is merely the cost to install a new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, sometimes in concrete. It is rather common to leave the old pipes in place after detaching them. The new pipe is simply installed in the path of least resistance.
