<p>Proper equipment combined with experience provides a plumber the ability to spot leaks in supply of water pipes, systems and toilets, drains, steams pipes, oil pipes, and more. Recognizing and repairing a leak can avoid damage and costly repairs. If you have old piping in your house, you may find that your water pipes are leaking or you have low water pressure.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Once set up, these BPAs go through routine and initial testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional efficiency. Such testing should be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin.
