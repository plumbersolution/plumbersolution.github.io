<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. First, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might use up to 3 weeks or more to approve and process.

<p>On and off does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is generally found before it causes any substantial damage. The water leak is normally the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to constantly leak out really slowly. With time it can lead to a significant build of water. Leaked water normally stays under your home and fills into the ground soil. This can possibly cause a cavity if the house's structure was not correctly compacted. This is a rare occasion and in general, there is little issue over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
<p>One common method for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water supply.</p>
