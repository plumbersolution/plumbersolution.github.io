<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
