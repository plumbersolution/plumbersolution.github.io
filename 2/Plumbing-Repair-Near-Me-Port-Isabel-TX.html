Rather, our technicians use a rupturing tool that forces the existing pipeline to burst" and disintegrate.

This repair approach is normally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or bigger pipe.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
