<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building permit is usually needed prior to a plumbing authorization can be provided. Soften only what you need to. People often choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be linked to a softener. In many cases, people pick to soften just the warm water.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet varies between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of homeowners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
