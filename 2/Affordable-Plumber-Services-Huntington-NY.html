<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
