<p>Apollo Plumbing Service uses Portland and Vancouver extensive rooter services, including emergency clog removals or regular maintenance services. Our machines run by snaking a turning cable television with an attached blade through your pipes. The blades will dislodge the build-up due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign items. Our professionals do not require large holes to place our equipment through, instead of depending on entry points through drains, resulting in a process that is minimally invasive, maintaining your home and property.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
