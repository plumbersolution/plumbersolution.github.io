<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it also.</p>
