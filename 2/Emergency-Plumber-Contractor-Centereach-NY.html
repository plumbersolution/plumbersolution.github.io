<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
