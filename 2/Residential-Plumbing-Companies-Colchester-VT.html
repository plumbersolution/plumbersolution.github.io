<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
