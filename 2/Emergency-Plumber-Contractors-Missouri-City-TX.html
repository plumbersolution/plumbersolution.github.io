<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process.

When the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
