<p>Also, if you have a 2-story house, it'll be more expensive to repipe since the plumber will need to navigate through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your home is a huge job - and it's a task you want to solve. But the range of plumbing pipe materials to pick from can make it confusing. Here we look at a few of the attributes of the major pipe types to help you select the ideal pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the major offenders. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to repair the problem and find for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
