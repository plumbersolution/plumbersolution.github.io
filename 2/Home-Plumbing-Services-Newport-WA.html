<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Since of the intrinsic style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or static flow condition may trigger problem dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
