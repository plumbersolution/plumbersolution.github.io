<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's required. When the tap is changed on, tankless systems specifically make use of a component that warms up water. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being warmed if the tap is immediately changed off.

Because they only heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than standard water heaters.</p>
