<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water system due to the fact that it can spread infected water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit pollutants or impurities to enter the safe and clean water supply. Illness can result from ingesting water that has actually been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>A plumbing authorization will consist of a statement directing that all work shall be performed in accordance with the construction documents submitted and accepted as part of the application. In addition, a permit will include the directive that the federal government or company accountable for enforcement of the code shall be alerted instantly in the event of changes happening throughout building and construction.</p>
