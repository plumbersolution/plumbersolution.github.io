<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a structure license is typically needed before a plumbing permit can be released. Soften just what you need to. People frequently pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps generally do not need to be connected to a softener. In a lot of cases, individuals choose to soften just the hot water.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
