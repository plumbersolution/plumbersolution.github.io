<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Tank water heaters are the most common, and are run with gas. Their design includes an insulated tank where water is heated and kept up until needed. Gas water heaters are more energy efficient and operating expense are reduced by about 50 percent, compared to electrical hot water heater. Tank water heaters have a greater initial cost than electrical.</p>
