Exemptions, which are approved in very rare cases where the building is considered to not posture a danger to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
