<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to consider. Energy Efficiency. Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is advisable. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is indicated by its Energy Factor (EF).
