<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
