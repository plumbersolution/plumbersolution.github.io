<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Waterford CT</h3>
<p>Examine the home's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion.</p>
