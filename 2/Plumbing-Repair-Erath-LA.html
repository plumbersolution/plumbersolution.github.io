<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
