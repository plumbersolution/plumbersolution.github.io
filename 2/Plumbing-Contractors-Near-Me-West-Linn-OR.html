I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
