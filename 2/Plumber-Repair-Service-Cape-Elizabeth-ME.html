<h3>When To Call A Plumber Cape Elizabeth ME</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system.

Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
