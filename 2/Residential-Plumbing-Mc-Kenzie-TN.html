<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Mc Kenzie TN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
