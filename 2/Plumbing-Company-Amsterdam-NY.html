Storm and hygienic piping will not be combined without approval of the Buffalo Sewer Authority and the Plumbing Department. When to repair: Under no circumstances must your toilet relocation when you press or sit on it. If your toilet relocations, contact a plumber The toilet might not have been set up properly, in which case the plumber may need to tighten its bolts or replace the wax seal around its base.
