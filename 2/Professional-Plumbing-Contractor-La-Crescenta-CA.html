<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber La Crescenta CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
