<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible option, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
