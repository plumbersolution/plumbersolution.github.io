<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
