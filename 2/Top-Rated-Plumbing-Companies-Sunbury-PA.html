<p>You can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
