<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative results and are, in truth, vital everyday nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing flavor many people find preferable.
