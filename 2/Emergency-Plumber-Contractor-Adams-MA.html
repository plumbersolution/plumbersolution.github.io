<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Adams MA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
