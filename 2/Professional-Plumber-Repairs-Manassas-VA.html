If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
