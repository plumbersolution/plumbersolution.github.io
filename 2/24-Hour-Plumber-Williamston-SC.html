Houses built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no idea that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health dangers related to lead.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to consider the age of your unit. If your system is getting near to 10 years old, it's normally not wise to pay for repairs if they are worth more than half of the price of a brand-new unit.

We offer a number of highly efficient and affordable systems, and offer upfront pricing before work starts so there are not a surprises.

Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who installs gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations need a license and inspection.</p>
