If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other two types of salts. Once the brand-new salt has actually had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
