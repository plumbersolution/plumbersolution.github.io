The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Because they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually restore after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
