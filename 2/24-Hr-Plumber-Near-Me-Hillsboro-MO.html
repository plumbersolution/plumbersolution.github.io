Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
