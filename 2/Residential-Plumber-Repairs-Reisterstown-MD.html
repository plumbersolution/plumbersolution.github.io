<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.
