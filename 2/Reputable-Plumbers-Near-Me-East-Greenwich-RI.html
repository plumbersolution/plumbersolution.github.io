<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Some house owners might think of water softeners as a luxury item, something that's good to have" but not completely needed.
