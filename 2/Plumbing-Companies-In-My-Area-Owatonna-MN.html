Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
