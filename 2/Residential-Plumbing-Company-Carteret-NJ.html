<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a potential problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise suggest the water heater is near the end of its life.
