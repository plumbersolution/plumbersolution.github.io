<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
