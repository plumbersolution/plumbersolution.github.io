How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you should first obtain the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for more information on obtaining a license. As soon as you acquire an authorization you can begin with the work. Nevertheless, you should require inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>
