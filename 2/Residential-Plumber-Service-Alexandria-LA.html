Chicago Gas Lines concentrates on natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, home appliances, heaters, generators & gas lights. When no other source of a leak can be figured out, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will want to unscrew the drain, and clean it thoroughly. Eliminate all of the previous plumber's putty by utilizing a scraper if it is embeded in location.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
