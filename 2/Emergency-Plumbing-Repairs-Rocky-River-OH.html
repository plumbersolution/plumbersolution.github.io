A toilet's tank is composed of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
