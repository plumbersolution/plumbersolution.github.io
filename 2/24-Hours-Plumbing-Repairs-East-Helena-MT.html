While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment.

<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the major offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
