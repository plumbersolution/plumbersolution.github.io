<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
