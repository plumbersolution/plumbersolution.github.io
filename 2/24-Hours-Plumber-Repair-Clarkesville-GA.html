If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and examine the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you observe water reappearing in your sink or shower?
