<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
