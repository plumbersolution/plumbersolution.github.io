Your kitchen might end up being clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it might be hair or pieces of soap that trigger the clog.

Any driver who overlooks a leaky fuel line is clearly at severe danger of ending up being a fire casualty, Lavacot states, as gas is spurting from their vehicle somewhere.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
