This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
