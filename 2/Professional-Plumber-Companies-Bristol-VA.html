<h3>Fast Emergency Plumbers Near Me Bristol VA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
