<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high price makes it unwise as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, sometimes, contain phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>

Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and safety cautions initially!).
