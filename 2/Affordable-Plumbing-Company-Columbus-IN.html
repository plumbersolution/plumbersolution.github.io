<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high price makes it unwise as a household option. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, sometimes, contain phosphates that damage the environment.
