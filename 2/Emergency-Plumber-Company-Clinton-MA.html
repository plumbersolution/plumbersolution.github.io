Further, it needs to be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, manufacturer requirements, and engineering standards for the kind of system to be used.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
