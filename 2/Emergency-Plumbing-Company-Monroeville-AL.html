<p>No, you should NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about securing your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than useful, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, consisting of both water system and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe is worth the financial investment in the long run because it may resolve the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in houses, businesses, and factories. They install plumbing components, such as bathtubs and toilets, and devices, such as dishwashers and hot water heater. They clean drains, remove obstructions, and repair or replace broken pipes and components. Plumbers likewise help preserve septic systems-- large, underground holding tanks that collect waste from homes that are not linked to a sewer system.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
