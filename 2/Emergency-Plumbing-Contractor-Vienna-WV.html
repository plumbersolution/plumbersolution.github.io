<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: bring wastewater out of a home or building. A lot of folks replace their hot water heater due to poor performance, complete failure or as a preventive measure.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
