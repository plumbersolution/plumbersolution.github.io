The direct exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so fatal that anybody who inhales it needs immediate medical attention. The Centers for Illness Control and Prevention exposed that 5149 individuals died from carbon monoxide gas poisoning in between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this catastrophe, make certain to use your gas ranges precisely as instructed and never to utilize them to heat your house.

Numerous households die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning overnight. Another safety measure to take is to never run your generators in enclosed spaces.
