<p>Backflow is a prospective issue in a water system since it can spread infected water back through a circulation system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or prospective connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable contaminants or toxins to get in the safe and clean water system.
