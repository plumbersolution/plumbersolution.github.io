When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

By calling Bell Cow at (844) 234-2355 upon very first noticing a problem, you can prevent more severe issues caused by leakages, like structural damage. Do not get milked by your water costs either!

Tough water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
