<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a range of factors, including poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older areas where clay pipe might have been used.
