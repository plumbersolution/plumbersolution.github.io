When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
