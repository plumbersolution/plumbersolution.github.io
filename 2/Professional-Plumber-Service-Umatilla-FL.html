<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of preserving the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. However, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is another crucial aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
