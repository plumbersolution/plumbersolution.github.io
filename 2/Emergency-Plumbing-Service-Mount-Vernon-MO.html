<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes.
