Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>The typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
