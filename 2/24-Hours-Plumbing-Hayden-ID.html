<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Hayden ID 83835?</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with tough water, you may not realize how much it affects you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of shampoos and soaps, triggering you to use more. Tough water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
