<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
