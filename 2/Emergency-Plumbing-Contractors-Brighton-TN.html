<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
