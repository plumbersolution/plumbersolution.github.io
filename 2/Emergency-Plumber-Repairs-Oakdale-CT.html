<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
