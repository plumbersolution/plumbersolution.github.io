<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.

If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
