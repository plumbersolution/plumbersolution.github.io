<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
