<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Mililani HI</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
