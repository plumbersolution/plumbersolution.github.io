<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complex than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to link wires precisely, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
