<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
