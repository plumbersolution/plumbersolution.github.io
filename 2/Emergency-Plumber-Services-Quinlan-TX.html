The minerals that trigger difficult water stay with the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a building authorization is normally required before a plumbing license can be issued. Soften only what you need to. People often pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps typically do not need to be linked to a softener. In most cases, people choose to soften only the hot water.</p>
