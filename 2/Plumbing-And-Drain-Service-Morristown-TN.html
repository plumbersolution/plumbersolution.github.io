<p>The electrical and plumbing work associated with waste disposal unit installation make the job possibly harmful. That makes it an excellent factor to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. House owners can either buy the brand-new disposal themselves and provide it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the general cost.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can attempt discarding a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then turn on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, broken sink? No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group does the job rapidly and cost effectively.</p>
