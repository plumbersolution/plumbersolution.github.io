<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
