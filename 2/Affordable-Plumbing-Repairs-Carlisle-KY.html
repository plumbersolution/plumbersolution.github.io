If you do not understand your design number, however, we do offer a substantial choice of "will fit" flappers to help you out. Watch the video listed below to read more about the various type of flappers offered, or go to How To Replace Toilet Flappers for quick tutorials on changing toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
