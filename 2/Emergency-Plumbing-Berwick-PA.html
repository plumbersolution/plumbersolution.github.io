<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
