<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>If you suspect your toilet has a leak, fortunately is that it does not always need a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
