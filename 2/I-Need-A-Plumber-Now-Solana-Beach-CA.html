<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
