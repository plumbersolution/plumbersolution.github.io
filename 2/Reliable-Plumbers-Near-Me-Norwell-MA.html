<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
