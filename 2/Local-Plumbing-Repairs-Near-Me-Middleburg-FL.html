It didn't just improve and make cleaning simpler, but it helps minimize waste also. A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement designed to prevent the reversal of the circulation of water once it has actually travelled through the valve. The 2 types of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 really different products, however they both have incredible durability and longevity.</p>
