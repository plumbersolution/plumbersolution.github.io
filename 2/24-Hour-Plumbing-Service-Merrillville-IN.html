<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a bit more pricey but are also extremely practical, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras work in locating buried septic tanks or checking the condition of buried pipes to determine appropriate maintenance schedules or the degree of needed repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in extremely bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
