<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each element. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
