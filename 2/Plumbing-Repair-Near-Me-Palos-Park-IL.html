<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink connector needs to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires precisely, and the base covered to safeguard the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
