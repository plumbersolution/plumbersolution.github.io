Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while.

Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>
