Once it has actually passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan created to avoid the turnaround of the flow of water.

New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be provided to the City of Bellingham.
