<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
