These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
