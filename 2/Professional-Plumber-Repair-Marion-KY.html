Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
