<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
