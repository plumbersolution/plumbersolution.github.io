Homes integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health threats connected with lead.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
