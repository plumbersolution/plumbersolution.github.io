A basic manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
