<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
