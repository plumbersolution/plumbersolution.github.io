<p>Roto-Rooter uses electromechanical cable makers, and if required, high-pressure water jetting to break through hard roofing drain clogs of all kinds, and thoroughly clean the drains right down to the pipe walls. Your Roto-Rooter drain technician will visually inspect your commercial roofing drain system then quote you a fair price for cleaning it, based on the size and length of the pipes.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can cause trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>The Department of Public Health charges a $100 cost for plumbing authorizations. All license costs are payable by check or cash order only. Pay to the State of Delaware.
