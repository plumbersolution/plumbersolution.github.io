<p>There are different causes for obstructions depending upon where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive bathroom tissue for the most part. When the toilet paper collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water just back up in the bowl. There are times when our plumber has to eliminate the toilet to unclog the drain correctly.</p>
