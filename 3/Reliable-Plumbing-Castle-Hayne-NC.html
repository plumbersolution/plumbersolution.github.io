<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. When this occurs, it normally indicates wear and tear which is a fair sign that its time is up. Leakages can be unhygienic and will also eventually trigger stress on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal. The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening up or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might have to fill the sink with water prior to taking a look at the pipe beneath.</p>
