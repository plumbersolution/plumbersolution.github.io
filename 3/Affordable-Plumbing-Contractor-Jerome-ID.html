<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To preserve your house, safety, and health comfort, we utilize just the very best piping: polyethylene.

Copper is also frequently used because of its longevity and much safer construction, however polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the market and ensures the healthiest and cleanest water circulation.</p>
