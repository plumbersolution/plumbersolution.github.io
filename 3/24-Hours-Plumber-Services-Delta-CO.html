Difficult water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
