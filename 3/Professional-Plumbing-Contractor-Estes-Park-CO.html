<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Estes Park CO</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the outcomes to us.
