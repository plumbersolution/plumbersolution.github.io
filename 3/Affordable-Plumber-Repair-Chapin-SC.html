Take it out totally and clean it completely if the trap continues to leak. If you suspect a clog, you can opt to clear the drain with the assistance of an auger.

<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in Chapin South Carolina</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
