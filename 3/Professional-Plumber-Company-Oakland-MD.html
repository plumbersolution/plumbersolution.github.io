<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

This could mean that the water does not have a clear path to do through, most likely since of a blocked drain. This is also the best time to add the cord and plug to your disposal.
