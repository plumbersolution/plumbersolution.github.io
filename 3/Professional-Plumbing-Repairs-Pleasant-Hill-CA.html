Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol.

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is far more efficient at removing obstructions. Many homes have drain cleanouts, nevertheless, we encounter older houses without cleanouts. If you are having drain problems, a professional plumber can add cleanouts to your home.</p>
