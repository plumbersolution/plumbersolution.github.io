<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and responsibility are extremely essential to constructing a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
