The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being warmed if the tap is immediately changed off. The heating temperature is generally pre-set to match your preferences and requirements. Because they only heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
