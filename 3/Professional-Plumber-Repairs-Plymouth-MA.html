<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
