<p>Your water heater is among the most important elements of your home's plumbing system Water heaters are responsible for producing all of the heated water you need for bathing, cleaning, cooking, and taking care of other day-to-day jobs.

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
