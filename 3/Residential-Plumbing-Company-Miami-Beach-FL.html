Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
