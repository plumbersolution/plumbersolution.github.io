Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
