<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop.

That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
