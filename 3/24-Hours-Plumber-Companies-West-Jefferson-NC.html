<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for residents. A PE or RA can assist identify if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try disposing a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that switch on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it as well. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, worn sink? No issue is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing team does the job quickly and economically.</p>
