<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day use need to not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and stable  location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You should also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
