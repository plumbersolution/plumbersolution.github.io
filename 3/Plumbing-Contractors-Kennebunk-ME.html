<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Backpressure takes place when the pressure in a private water system exceeds the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can cause normal flow to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
