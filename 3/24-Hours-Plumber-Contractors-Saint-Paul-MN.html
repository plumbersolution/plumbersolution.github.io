<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible service, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
