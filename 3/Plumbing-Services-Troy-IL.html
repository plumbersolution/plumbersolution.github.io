These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than changing with a various model.

A completely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
