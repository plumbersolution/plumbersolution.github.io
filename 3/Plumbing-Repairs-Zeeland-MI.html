<p>Inspect the home's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and readily available for use.

Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration.</p>
