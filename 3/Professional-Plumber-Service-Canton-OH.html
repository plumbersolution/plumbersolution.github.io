<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a steady and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you must wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You need to also examine to ensure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
