You can position your house plumbing needs in the hands of Ritz's plumbers with self-confidence.

<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>The Battelle Study also found difficult water to rapidly cause clogged shower heads, in some cases after just a year and a half of routine use. After simply one week of continuous testing with difficult water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles became clogged, according to lab results. Shower heads using water dealt with by a water softening system, on the other hand, performed nearly as well as on the day they were installed.</p>
