Standard tank hot water heater: These hot water heater are normally powered by gas or electrical power. They hold 20 to 100 gallons of water, depending on the needs of your household.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation.
