<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
