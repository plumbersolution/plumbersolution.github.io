<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
