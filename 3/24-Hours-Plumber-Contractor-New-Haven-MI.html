<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
