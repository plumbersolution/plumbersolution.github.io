<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish.

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for numerous seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
