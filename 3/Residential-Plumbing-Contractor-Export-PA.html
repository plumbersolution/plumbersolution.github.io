<p>Water temperature concerns can be fixed by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for performing annual forward circulation tests are in some cases viewed as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
