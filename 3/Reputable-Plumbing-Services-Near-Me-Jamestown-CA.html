The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
