<p>Bought middle ground stainless steel blade design readily available at Lowes.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
