Backflow can take place in a variety of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
