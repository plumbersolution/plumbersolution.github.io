<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for the majority of building contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thus eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
