<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

We make every effort to satisfy our consumers, and our efforts to keep the procedure environment-friendly and painless is a crucial component of our work.</p>
