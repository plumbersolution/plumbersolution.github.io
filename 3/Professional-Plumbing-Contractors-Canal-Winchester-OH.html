<p>First consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be needed. Typically, relining your existing pipes is a better alternative. If your sewer lines are beneath trees, near substantial landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, total sewer excavation can trigger a lot of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Supply of water by the public utility contains some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems get rid of these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are vital requirements, not optional expenses. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
