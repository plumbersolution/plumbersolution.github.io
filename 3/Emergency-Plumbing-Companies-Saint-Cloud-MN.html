<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
