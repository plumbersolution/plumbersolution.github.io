<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backward into city water supplies.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be repaired by changing that area of harmed piping. However, when the issue is discovered in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to consider whole-house repiping.
