The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin.

Plumbers can attempt to recreate problems to determine if something may be happening behind the walls or in the ground. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more effective at eliminating blockages. Many homes have drain cleanouts, however, we encounter older houses without cleanouts. A professional plumber can add cleanouts to your home if you are having drain problems.</p>
