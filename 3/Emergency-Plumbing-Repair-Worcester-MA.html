<p>Aside from these 2 important elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

We will assist you prevent the risks of incorrect sink installation, guaranteeing that your new sink fits in the spot you have, all pipes are functional, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works terrific.</p>
