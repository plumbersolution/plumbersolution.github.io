<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
