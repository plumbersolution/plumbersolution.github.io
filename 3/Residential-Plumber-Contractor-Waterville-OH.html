<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70.

<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a blockage. The other is to go on and replace the whole line.
