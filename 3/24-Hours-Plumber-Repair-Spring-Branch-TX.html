<p>If you discover low water pressure or blemished water, it typically represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized throughout regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
