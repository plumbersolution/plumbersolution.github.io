<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>

<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Don't get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically sodium. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap scum accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is thought about extremely low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically regrow after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
