<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
