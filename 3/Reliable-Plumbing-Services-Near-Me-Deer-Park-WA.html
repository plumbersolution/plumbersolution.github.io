<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
