Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
