<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.

<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pushed forward into the home, enabling it to stream backward into city water products.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
