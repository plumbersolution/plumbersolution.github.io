A plumber will insert a specifically developed waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video to determine where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>Most common single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than 3‚ÅÑ4 inch (19 mm) due to cost along with steel piping's tendency to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the within the pipe in time once the internal galvanizing zinc covering has actually degraded. In drinkable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water pollutants.</p>
