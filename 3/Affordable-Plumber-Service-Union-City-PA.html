<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. Numerous houses in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't found soon.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
