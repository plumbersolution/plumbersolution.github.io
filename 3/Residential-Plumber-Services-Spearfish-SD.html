<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will establish. Often the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to resolve the problem. Other times a more substantial option is required: repiping.</p>
<p>We have two no-dig techniques to repair your sewer line: CIPP and pipe bursting. We complete CIPP repairs without any excavation. Pipe rupturing needs restricted digging. Both approaches are becoming more popular with our customers, but many individuals aren't familiar with these trenchless techniques.
