<p>Debris such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can end up being trapped in between your drainpipe and your pipes. These will eventually obstruct the flow of your water prior to causing a clog. Also, if too much toilet tissue is flushed down your toilet, or sanitary products are flushed, a clog can take place. Thermostat issues: The thermostat controls the temperature of the hot water heater. You may be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this part malfunctions.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floorings, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
