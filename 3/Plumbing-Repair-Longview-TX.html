<p>Since it can spread contaminated water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a possible problem in a water system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any possible or actual connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit pollutants or toxins to enter the drinkable water system.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
