The age of your house is a crucial component to understand whether you must repipe your home. This is not just because your plumbing has aged with time, but also because houses that were built prior to a particular period are more likely to include galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was constructed years before that, chances are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates.</p>
