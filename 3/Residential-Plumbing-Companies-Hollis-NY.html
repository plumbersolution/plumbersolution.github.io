<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public water system and private on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow techniques offer an increased level of security for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
