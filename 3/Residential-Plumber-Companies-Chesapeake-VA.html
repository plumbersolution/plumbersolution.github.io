<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Chesapeake VA</h3>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
