<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature level and pressure relief valve is part of the unit for that precise factor. But while little drips should not be trigger for issue, property owners must watch on the hot water heater leaks. When we needed a leak in a pipe repaired, I had a great experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was professional and friendly. He also finished the job faster than initial approximated, so the work was less expensive than I prepared for. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
