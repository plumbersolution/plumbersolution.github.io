<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
