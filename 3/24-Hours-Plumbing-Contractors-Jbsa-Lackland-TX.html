<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing problems plumbers face, and for many people, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware shop. The only function of salt in a water softener is to regrow the resin beads that take the hardness out of water.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
