<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your safety, benefit, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. Diane Heether is a city local of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener installed in her house.

Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
