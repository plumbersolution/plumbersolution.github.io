<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backward into city water products.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening systems are for that reason also known as ion exchange water softeners. The best way to clear a clogged drain without damaging your pipes and plumbing system is to call a trusted local plumber at ABC. The pipe that links your sink to the main supply, contains water at high pressures. A leak in this unit will be instantly obvious. The defected part will either spray or drip profusely, depending on the damage.</p>
