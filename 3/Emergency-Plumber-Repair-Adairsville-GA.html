<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to go through. The pipes often make unusual gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird noises originating from your sink.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
