<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Thomasville AL</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are correctly maintained. Ensuring the brine tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the system. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
