<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>

And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
