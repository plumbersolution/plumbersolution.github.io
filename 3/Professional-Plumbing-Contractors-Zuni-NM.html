<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
