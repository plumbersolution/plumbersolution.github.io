<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Cold Spring MN</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You've got an issue with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet constantly running is typical to you. This water is being dumped down the overflow tube losing as much as 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water costs, not to discuss the danger of a more severe leak that could wreak havoc on your house with flooding.</p>
