<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
