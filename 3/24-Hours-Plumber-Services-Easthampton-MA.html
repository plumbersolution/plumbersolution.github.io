<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth understanding about garbage disposal installation. You rely on your hot water heater every day for all the warm water you and your household need to prepare, clean, and bathe.

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
