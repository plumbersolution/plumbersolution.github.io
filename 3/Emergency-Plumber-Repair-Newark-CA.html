<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Newark CA</h3>
<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause considerable problems. Even small leakages can slowly moisten walls and floors till they become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants.

Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to address this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
