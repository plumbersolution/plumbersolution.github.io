<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process.

When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
