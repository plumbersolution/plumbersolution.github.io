<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

In addition, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly location in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
