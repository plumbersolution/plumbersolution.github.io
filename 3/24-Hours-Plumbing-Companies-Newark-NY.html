It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>

Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
