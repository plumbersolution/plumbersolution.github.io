<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
