Normally, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run because it might resolve the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>You'll need to install that initially if your disposal's installation will require a brand-new installing flange in the sink. If you're changing an old disposer, remove it as talked about above.
