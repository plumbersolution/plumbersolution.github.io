Many of us fall under a routine of preparing our lives around warm water without even realizing it. Thankfully, the hybrid tank-tankless water heaters that we offer offer the best of both worlds. By setting up a system that's similar to a requirement tank hot water heater, you can experience hot water right when you need it for as long as you need it.</p>

Confronted with a stubborn clog that just won't budge? Property owners in the South Plainfield, NJ area concern us when they need a drain cleaning company. If you need to arrange a consultation, offer us a call at (908) 226-1616.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
