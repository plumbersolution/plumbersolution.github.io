<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
