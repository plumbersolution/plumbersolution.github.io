During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

Depending on the seriousness of the scenario, just one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly should be removed and replaced. Elements involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
