<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
