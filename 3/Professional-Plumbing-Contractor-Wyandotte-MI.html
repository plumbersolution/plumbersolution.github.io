<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
