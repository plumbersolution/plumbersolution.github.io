Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
