<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of maintaining the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you see strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
