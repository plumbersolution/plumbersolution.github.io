<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a substandard plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
