<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Fair Oaks CA 95628?</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
