<p>The more often a waste disposal unit is used (properly), the better it will grind food waste and resist rusting. You can keep odors away by grinding up lemon or orange peels inside it.

It's an excellent idea to discover a plumber that offers an extensive variety of plumbing services. Remember you want a one-stop store-- that is, one company you can require your various plumbing requirements.</p>

<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink.
