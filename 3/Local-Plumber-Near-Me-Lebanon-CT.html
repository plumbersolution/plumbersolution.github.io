<p>Installation and replacement costs are often equivalent, though replacement normally will not require added fees, such as application charges.

Plumbing services will utilize more materials which adds to your labor costs.</p>
<p>It assists to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand name is typically on the bowl behind the seat.
