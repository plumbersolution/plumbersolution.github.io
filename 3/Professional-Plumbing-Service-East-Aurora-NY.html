<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
