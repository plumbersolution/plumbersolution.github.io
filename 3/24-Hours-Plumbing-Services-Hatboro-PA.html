<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is instantly turned off, the water stops being warmed. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to match your choices and requirements. Tankless electric water heaters use less power than standard water heaters due to the fact that they only heat water when needed.</p>
