<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
