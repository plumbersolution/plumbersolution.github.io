<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a fantastic option for many people, there are some circumstances where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the process of changing old corroded pipes with lasting and resilient brand-new pipes. Because of their durability and other factors, the new pipes that are utilized are usually made of copper. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
