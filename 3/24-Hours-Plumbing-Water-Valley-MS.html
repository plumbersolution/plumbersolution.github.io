<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
