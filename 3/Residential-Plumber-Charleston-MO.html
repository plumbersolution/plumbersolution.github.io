<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
