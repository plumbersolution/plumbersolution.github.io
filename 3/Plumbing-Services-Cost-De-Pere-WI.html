<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed throughout building of a new or refurbished building is installed by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with relevant codes.

When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining component itself. Obstructions in a component can trigger harmful damage to your draining pipes system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>Checking the water, condition, and age lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand numerous things, including water pressure and indications of leaks. It can likely last beyond its standard service warranty if the water heater has been maintained with annual flush service.

<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you notice that your plumbing experiences many blockages, leaks, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you should speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service.
