Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. It normally indicates wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up when this occurs. Leakages can be unhygienic and will likewise eventually trigger pressure on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal. The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the evident spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might need to fill the sink with water before analyzing the pipe underneath.</p>
