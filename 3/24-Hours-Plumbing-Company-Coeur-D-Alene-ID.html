Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.

The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.
