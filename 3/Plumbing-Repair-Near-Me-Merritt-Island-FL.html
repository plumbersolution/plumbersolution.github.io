<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
