<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Auburndale MA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
