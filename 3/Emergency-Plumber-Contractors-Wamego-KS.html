<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you ought to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils.
