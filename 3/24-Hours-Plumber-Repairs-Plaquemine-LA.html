In this technique, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
<p>Toilets can be finicky and tricky at times, depending upon what parts have actually stopped working and the specific situation of your installation.

If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.
