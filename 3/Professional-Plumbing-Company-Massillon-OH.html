Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
