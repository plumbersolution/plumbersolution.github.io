<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
