<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
