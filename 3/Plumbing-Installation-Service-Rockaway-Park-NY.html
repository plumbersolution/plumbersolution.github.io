Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
