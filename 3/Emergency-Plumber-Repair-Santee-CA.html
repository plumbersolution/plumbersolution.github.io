<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house.

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
