<p>While combating a fire, firemens are naturally more concerned about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they use water from any available source to accomplish their goal, however fire department lorries often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>One typical way for a house's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem might spread significantly. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and contaminating the public water supply.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try discarding a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then switch on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food particles stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, broken sink? No issue is undue for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing team gets the job done quickly and cost effectively.</p>
