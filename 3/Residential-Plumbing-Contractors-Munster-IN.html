<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Munster IN</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
