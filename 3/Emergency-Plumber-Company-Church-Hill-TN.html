When no other source of a leak can be figured out, it is safe to assume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet.

<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of most affordable pressure.
