<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
