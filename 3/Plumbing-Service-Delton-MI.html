<p>Our plumber teams aim to keep your house and work places efficient, comfy and practical. When it rains, any excess water is expected to decrease a storm drain in order to avoid flooding problems. If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your residential or commercial property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a prompt way, the chances are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies.

Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
