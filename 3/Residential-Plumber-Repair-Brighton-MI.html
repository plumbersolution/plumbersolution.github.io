<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the service with hardness ions.

The resulting soft water system is without firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
