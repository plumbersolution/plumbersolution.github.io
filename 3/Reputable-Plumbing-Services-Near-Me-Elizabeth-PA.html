<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
