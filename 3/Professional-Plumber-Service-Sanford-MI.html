<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, however easy to correct. It uses salt to get rid of smells and minerals found in difficult water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attract and connect salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
