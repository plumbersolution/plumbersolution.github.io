<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>

<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the significant culprits. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the problem for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it causes further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
