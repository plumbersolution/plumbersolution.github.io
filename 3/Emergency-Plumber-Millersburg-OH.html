<p>Family ran and owned since 2003, RT Plumbing Services provides industry-leading plumbing competence, house remodeling service, and hot water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX neighborhood. It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
