<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working successfully due to the fact that difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
