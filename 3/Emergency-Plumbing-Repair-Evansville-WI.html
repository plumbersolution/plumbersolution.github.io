Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
<p>Over time, like any other home appliance in your house, your garbage disposal. may need repairs. A disposal system may clog or begin to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use.
