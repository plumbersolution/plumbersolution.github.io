They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was super happy with their service.</p>
