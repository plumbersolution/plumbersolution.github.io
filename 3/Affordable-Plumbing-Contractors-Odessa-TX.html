<h3>Sewer Cleaning in Odessa Texas</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To avoid this, make sure the brand-new garbage disposal installation package includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
