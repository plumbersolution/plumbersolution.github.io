Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.
