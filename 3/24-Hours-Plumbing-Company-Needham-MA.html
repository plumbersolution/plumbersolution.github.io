<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
