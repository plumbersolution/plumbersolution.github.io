<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of keeping the integrity and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you see strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect. Lacking hot water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Gas is tough to spot, as it's a colorless, odor-free compound. We utilize natural gas in our homes with gas heaters, stoves, and ovens.
