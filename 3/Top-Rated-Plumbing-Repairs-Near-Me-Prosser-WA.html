<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Supply of water by the public utility consists of some quantities of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are essential requirements, not optional expenditures. A home plumbing inspection will either be visual, finished with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
