<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning devices have been marketed based on a range of claims concerning their impact on water hardness and associated scale formation.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
