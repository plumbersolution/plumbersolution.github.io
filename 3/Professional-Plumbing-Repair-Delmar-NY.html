Instead of needing to put the waste into the garbage, where it might possibly end up in a landfill, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into small particles that can be flushed to the sewage-disposal tank or sewer.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there need to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
