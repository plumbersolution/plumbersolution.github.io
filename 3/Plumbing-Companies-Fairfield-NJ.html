Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
