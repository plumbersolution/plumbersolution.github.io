<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. If you would like to attempt the gentlest method possibly try utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security cautions first!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust spots and it's easily available at most hardware shops.</p>
