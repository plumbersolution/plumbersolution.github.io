<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Lansing KS</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
