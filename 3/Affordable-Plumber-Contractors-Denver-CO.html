<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see however hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
