<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
