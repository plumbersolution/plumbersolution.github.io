<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Clackamas OR</h3>

It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
