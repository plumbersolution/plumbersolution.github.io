<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and blockages - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain too. After finishing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
