<p>Toilet repair tends to freak many people out a little, which is completely easy to understand. Nobody wants to accidentally break something that might flood their bathroom with raw sewage. However, most of toilet repairs are simple and easy jobs - such as changing a used flapper - that most people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.
