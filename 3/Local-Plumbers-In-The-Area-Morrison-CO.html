It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be supplied.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to the City of Bellingham.

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Morrison CO</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
