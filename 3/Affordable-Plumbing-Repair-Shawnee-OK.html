Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from adhering to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>
