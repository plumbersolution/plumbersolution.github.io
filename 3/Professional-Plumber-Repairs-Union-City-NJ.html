<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>

Fixing those leaks can save you 10 percent on your water expenses each year.</p>
