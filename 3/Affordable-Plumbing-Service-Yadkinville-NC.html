Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
