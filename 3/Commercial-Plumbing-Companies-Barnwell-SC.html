<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Barnwell SC 29812?</h3>
<p>If you have actually constantly resided in an area with difficult water, you may not understand how much it affects you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water.

Hard water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
