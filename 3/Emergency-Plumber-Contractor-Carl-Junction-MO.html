<h3>Prices For Unclogging And Video Inspection Carl Junction MO</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
