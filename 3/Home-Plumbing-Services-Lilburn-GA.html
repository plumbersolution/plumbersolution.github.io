<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to utilize a growing number of cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regrowth. Lastly, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
