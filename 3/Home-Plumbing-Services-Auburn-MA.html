<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of maintaining the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other.

There is one other vital aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
