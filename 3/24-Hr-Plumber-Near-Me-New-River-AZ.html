<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
