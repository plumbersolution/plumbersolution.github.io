<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Your water heater. The pro will next check your hot water heater.
