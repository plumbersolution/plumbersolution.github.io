<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of preserving the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this might be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating aspect. Lacking hot water rapidly is another indication of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
