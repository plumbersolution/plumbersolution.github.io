<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Many property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their unclean or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and economical, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
