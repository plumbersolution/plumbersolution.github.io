<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Hugo OK</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
