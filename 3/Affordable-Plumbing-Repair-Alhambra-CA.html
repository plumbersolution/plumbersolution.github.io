<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
