They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
