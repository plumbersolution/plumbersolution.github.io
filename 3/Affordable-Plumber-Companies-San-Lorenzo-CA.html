<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the service is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is necessary to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Today, many professionals advise a cautious inspection of residential water heaters regularly - at least yearly. Malfunctioning water heaters cause a variety of problems. These concerns run the gamut from slow or undependable water heating to costly water leakages and potential fire risks.
