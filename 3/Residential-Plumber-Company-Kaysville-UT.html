<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, consisting of poor soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older areas where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as intensified if pipes have been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the service technician to precisely examine conditions and identify the functionality of the pipes. The info we obtain from the inspection allows us to make an informed decision concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the best option as well. We can make the perfect suggestion with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned of clogs or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
