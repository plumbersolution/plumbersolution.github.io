<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Company in Columbus</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and obligation are incredibly essential to constructing a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water supply within a structure these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
