<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible service, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
