<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
