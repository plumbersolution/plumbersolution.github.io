<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
