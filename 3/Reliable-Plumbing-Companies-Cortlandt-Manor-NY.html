<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. Checking the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and inspect. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be severe problem. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in the house need to have water. This opts for every other shut down valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a good start if whatever is working correctly.</p>
