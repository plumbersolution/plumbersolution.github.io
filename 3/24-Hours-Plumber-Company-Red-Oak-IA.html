<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair.
