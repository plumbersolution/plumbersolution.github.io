<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed throughout building of a brand-new or renovated building is installed by educated artisans in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.
