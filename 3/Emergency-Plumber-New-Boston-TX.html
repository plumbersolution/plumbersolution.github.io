<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program safeguards the general public water system from toxins and contaminants that could, under certain scenarios, be drawn into the general public water supply from private properties.

When installing a new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
