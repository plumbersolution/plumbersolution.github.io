<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
