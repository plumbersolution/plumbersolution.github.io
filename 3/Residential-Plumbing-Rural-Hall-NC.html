<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
