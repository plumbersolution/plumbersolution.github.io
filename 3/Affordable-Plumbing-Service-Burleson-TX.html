<p>It's an oddly complicated clinical process, but easy to correct. It uses salt to eliminate odors and minerals found in tough water- most frequently calcium and magnesium.

Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
