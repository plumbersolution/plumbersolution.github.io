<p>Numerous property owners think their utility companies or property owners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that in most cases you, the property owner, are responsible. Many fundamental property owners insurance plan and local energy companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your home.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
