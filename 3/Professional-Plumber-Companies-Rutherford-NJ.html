Leaky and cracked drains waste water that ends up costing you cash in addition to harming the environment. Stopping these leaks and fixing broken pipes is especially crucial in an area as drought-stricken as Los Angeles where summertime water allotments are low, and costs are high.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it.
