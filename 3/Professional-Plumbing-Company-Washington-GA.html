<p>As a locally-owned organisation, stability and duty are exceptionally important to developing a track record for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to offer one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
