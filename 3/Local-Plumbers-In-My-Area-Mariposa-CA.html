<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
