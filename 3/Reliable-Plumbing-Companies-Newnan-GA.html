<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
