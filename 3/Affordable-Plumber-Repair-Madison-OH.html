<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
