<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared cleaning agent dose, water solidity, and washing temperature level to see if hardness had an influence on detergent savings. The study consisted of tests that removed hard soils, in addition to examining finding and filming. Scientists discovered that softened water uses nearly 30% less cleaning agent, however cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent cost savings rises to almost 70%.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular pollutants that homeowners are handling and an RO can assist ease those concerns. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.
