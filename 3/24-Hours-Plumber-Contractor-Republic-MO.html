<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system providing the makeup water, backpressure is developed. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then enter the safe and clean water system. The very best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially tough with high mineral material, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
