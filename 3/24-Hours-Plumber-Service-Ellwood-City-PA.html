Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
