<p>3. Solar Salt originates from vaporized seawater and may sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is really a harmless germs that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your house. Once the new salt has had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
