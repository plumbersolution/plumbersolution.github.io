<p>Lots of property owners think their utility companies or homeowners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in many cases you, the homeowner, are responsible. Most fundamental homeowners insurance policies and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your home.</p>

If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater really rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
