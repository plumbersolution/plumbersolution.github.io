<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
