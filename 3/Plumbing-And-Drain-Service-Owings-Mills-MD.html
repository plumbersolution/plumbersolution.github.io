<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water main could drop. The demand upstream might cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
