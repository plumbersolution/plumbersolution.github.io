Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

New assemblies need to be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham.
