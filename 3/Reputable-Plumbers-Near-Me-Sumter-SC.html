<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Sumter SC</h3>
<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water supply. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
