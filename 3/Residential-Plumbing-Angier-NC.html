<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
