<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, since the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
