<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
