<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
