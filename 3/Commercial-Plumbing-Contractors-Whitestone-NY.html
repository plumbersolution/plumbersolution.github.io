<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank.

The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
