<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you must first get the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page for additional information on getting a license. When you get a permit you can begin with the work. However, you need to require inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Very seldom does any structural damage occur as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically identified before it triggers any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to continually leak out really gradually. In time it can lead to a significant develop of water. Leaked water usually remains under your home and saturates into the ground soil. This can potentially trigger a cavity if the house's foundation was not correctly compacted. This is a rare occasion and in general, there is little issue over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain because they usually contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, blocking them.
