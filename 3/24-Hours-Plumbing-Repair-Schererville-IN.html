<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you should first obtain the needed authorization( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Permit page for additional information on acquiring a permit. Once you acquire an authorization you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you must require inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>

<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances.

<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
