<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished.

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Municipal - Hard water can cause a lack of suds formation when soap is upset in water and cause the development of lime scale in hot water heater. Your water is brown or red. Some types of pipes can rust over time. This rust will break off into your home's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color. In this case, repiping your house is required because not just are your pipes old, but your water quality is impacted as well.</p>
