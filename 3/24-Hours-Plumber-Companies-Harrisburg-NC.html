<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and household.</p>
