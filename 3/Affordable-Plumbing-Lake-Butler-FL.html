It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
