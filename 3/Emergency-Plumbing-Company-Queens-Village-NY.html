<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently noted must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>When it concerns repairing a broken or stopping working sewer line, there are a couple of alternatives. The right choice for your home will depend upon a couple of aspects, including the age of your existing pipes, the extent of damage, and your spending plan. An approved backflow prevention device, which should be tested each year, should be installed on the service connection that the department has actually recognized as having a potential for backflow.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
