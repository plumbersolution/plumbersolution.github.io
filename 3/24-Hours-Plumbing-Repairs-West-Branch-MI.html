In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
