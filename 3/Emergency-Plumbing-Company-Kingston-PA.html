<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
