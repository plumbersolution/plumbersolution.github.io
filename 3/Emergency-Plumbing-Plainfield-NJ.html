Making use of these items is called chemigation. There are numerous parts to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which permits circulation in just one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last component is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are introduced to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can take place.</p>
