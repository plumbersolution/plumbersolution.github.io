<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during building of a new or remodelled building is installed by well-informed artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.
