<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Draper UT 84020 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>I have been impressed with your company and its people from the day your sales individual walked in here, through all service personel, and now. By the way, this is a wonderful system. Our energy costs are much lower then before, the airflow is almost undetectable, the air temp inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have had no failures considering that installation.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you also need to consider the age of your system. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's usually not wise to pay for repairs if they deserve more than half of the price of a brand-new system.
