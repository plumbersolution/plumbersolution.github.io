<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating element is taking longer to warm the water than it should. But this specific issue is when you have no hot water flowing in your house. The factors for this can vary from leakages, malfunctioning or defective electrical wiring, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat. If it is one of the mentioned issues, a repair or replacement of the elements might be enough. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening regularly, then a hot water heater replacement is essential.</p>
