<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This generally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

The brand-new pipes that are used are generally made from copper because of their sturdiness and other factors. Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
